This report provides an overview of the key aspects of Telugu literature before the 14th century.\\n\\n### Major Literary Works\\n\\nSeveral key works laid the foundation for Telugu literature. These works showcase the development of the language and the emergence of distinct literary styles:\\n\\n1.  **Andhra Mahabharatam by Nannayya Bhattaraka (1022–1063 CE):** Considered the first Telugu literary composition (Adi Kavyam), this is a Telugu translation and adaptation of the Sanskrit Mahabharata. It is significant for establishing Telugu as a literary language and for its poetic and narrative style [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nannayya).\\n2.  **Mahabharata translation by Tikkana (13th century):** Tikkana continued Nannayya's work by translating and elaborating on the Mahabharata. His contributions are a cornerstone of Telugu literary tradition, known for poetic excellence and religious themes [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkana).\\n3.  **Ramayana adaptations by Errana (13th century):** Errana translated and adapted parts of the Ramayana into Telugu. His works are notable for their devotional content and poetic craftsmanship, contributing to the Bhakti movement [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errana).\\n4.  **Sumati Shatakam by Baddena Bhupaludu (13th century):** This is a collection of moral and philosophical verses in Telugu. Baddena is celebrated for his poetic style and for enriching Telugu literature with works that blend moral teachings with literary elegance [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumati_Shatakam).\\n5.  **Works of Srinatha (14th century):** Srinatha's compositions include prabandhas and kavya. His works are important for their narrative richness and for shaping the Telugu literary tradition just before the 14th century.\\n\\n### Dynastic Patronage\\n\\nSeveral dynasties played a crucial role in fostering Telugu literature through their patronage:\\n\\n1.  **Andhra Dynasty (2nd century BCE to 3rd century CE):** This dynasty provided early support for Telugu literature, with evidence of literary activity and patronage [Vepachedu](https://www.vepachedu.org/andhra-kingdoms.html).\\n2.  **Satavahana Dynasty (2nd century BCE to 2nd century CE):** The Satavahanas supported the Telugu language and literature, establishing early literary traditions [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Andhra_Pradesh).\\n3.  **Ikshvaku Dynasty (circa 3rd to 4th century CE):** This dynasty contributed to the cultural and literary development of the region [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Andhra_Pradesh).\\n4.  **Velanati Cholas (ca. 1100-1300 CE):** Ruling parts of Andhra Pradesh, the Velanati Cholas supported Telugu literature, with poets and literary activity in their courts [inflibnet](https://ebooks.inflibnet.ac.in/icp01/chapter/major-dynasties-of-south-india-753-1300-ce).\\n5.  **Kakatiya Dynasty (1206-1323 CE):** The Kakatiyas, especially during Rudradeva's rule, fostered Telugu literature. Tikkana and other poets translated and composed important literary works [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakatiya_dynasty).\\n\\n### Development of Telugu Language and Script\\n\\nThe Telugu language and script evolved over centuries, with key milestones marking its development:\\n\\n*   **Earliest Telugu Words:** Evidence of Telugu words appears in Prakrit inscriptions dating to around the 4th century BCE, found in Bhattiprolu [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language).\\n*   **First Written Materials:** The first written materials in Telugu date from approximately 575 CE, originating from the Chalukya dynasty [TypeCraft](https://typecraft.org/tc2wiki/Telugu_The_Language).\\n*   **Earliest Telugu Inscription:** An inscription from around 633 CE in coastal Andhra Pradesh is considered the earliest Telugu inscription [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361133471_Impact_of_Writing_Tools_in_the_Evolution_of_Telugu_Script).\\n*   **Script Evolution:** The Telugu script is derived from the Brahmi script, with the Bhattiprolu script (3rd century BCE) as a key precursor [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_script).\\n*   **Literary Usage:** The script gained prominence during the Eastern Chalukyas (Vengi Chalukya era, 6th to 12th centuries CE). Nannaya's Andhra Mahabharatam (early 11th century) demonstrates the script's established use in literature [LearnLipi](https://learnlipi.com/telugu).\\n\\n### Literary Genres\\n\\nEarly Telugu literature featured various genres, each with its distinct characteristics:\\n\\n1.  **Champu:** A mixed genre of poetry and prose. Example: 'Andhra Mahabharatam' by Nannaya [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_literature).\\n2.  **Prabandha:** Classical Telugu poetry with elaborate themes. Example: 'Sarasvati Kalyanam' by Tikkana [Semantics Scholar PDF](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ddca/fe35eb606567d8e086b258679c9abdc71e35.pdf).\\n3.  **Itihasam:** Epic narratives recounting historical or legendary events. Example: 'Andhra Mahabharatam' by Nannaya [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nannayya).\\n4.  **Puranam:** Religious and mythological narratives. Example: Vishnu Purana translated into Telugu [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/art/Telugu-literature).\", parsed=None) cost_dollars=CostDollars(total=0.252855, num_pages=38.843, num_searches=10.0, reasoning_tokens=1728.0)\n"

      "Errana, also known as Errapragada or Erranna, was a 14th-century Telugu poet and a devotee of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. He was one of the kavitrayam (Trinity of Poets) who translated the Sanskrit Mahabharata into Telugu. He also wrote original works such as Harivamsamu, Ramayanamu, and Nrusimhapuranamu, based on Hindu scriptures and legends. He praised the glory and grace of the gods through his poetic language, which was rich in imagery, metaphors, and similes. He dedicated his works to King Prolaya Vema Reddy, the founder of the Reddy dynasty, who honored him with the titles Prabandha-parameshvara and Shambhudasudu.\n",
